About

The values must end with a CR or CRLF line break.

Currently, SerialSensor is only compatible with Linux/Unix based systems.

SerialSensor can represent the acquired data though JSON, numerical value lists or strings.

You will need the following packages:
    python 2.7 or above
    
    pySerial
