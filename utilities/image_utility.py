CityFARM Image Preparation Utility

image_utility TARGET_DISK SOURCE_IMAGE [ADDITIONAL_FILES]...

Instructions:
    1.  Files needed:
        Have on the same folder the following files, which are necessary for the proper
        operation of the board, be it an Air Board, or Water Board.
        Only the following files will be copied. If you wish to have other files copied,
        append its filenames as arguments.

        Files needed:
            config.json
            rpi_service.py
            rpi_service.service
            rpi_sh.sh
            sensor_terminal.py
            serialsensor.py
            archlinux_cityfarm_image_3_12_34_ARCH.img (or other CityFARM linux image)

    2.  Hardware Needed:
        An 8Gb SD Card connected to the computer, and have its path noted, for instance:
            SD Card at /dev/sdb
        It is vital that you get the correct path, or else the utility will unmercifully
        erase all data on that path, with no possibility of recovery.
        To make sure you have the correct path, you may execute an 'ls' command before
        and after inserting the SD Card; the new path that appears will most likely be
        the SD Card.
        An example of something you might see is:

            ==> (No SD card):
            user$: ls /dev
            bus         loop1       sda2         stdout
            cdrom       pts         sda5         tty0
            cdrw        ram0        sdb          ttyUSB0
            dvd         sda         stderr
            dvdrw       sda1        stdin
            ==> (Insert SD card)
            user$: ls /dev
            bus         loop1       sda2         stderr
            cdrom       pts         sda5         stdin
            cdrw        ram0        sdb          stdout
            dvd         sda         sdb1  <--    tty0       Note that sdb1 and sdb2 appeared
            dvdrw       sda1        sdb2  <--    ttyUSB0    after inserting the SD card.

        So the path you're interested in is: /dev/sdb
        It's worth it to point out that the path we're interested in is the disk itself,
        /dev/sdb, not /dev/sdb1 or 2 which corresponds to a partition within de disk sdb.

    3.  Information needed:
        The server address (URL or IP Address) in hands, as well as the username and password
        of the database.

    4.  
        If you have ALL the items above, you can proceed to burning your image
        into the SD Card. To do that, follow the instructions below:

        4.1 - On a terminal window, go to the directory containing the files needed on item 1,
        for instance:

            user$: cd ~/Documents/CityFARM/Sensor_Board
            user$: ls
            archlinux_cityfarm_image_3_12_34_ARCH.img        rpi_service.service
            config.json                                      rpi_sh.sh
            image_utility.py                                 sensor_terminal.py
            rpi_service.py                                   serialsensor.py

        4.2 - On the same terminal window, execute the Image Preparation Utility, if any additional
            files are to be added, add them as arguments, for instance:
            image_utility TARGET_DISK SOURCE_IMAGE [ADDITIONAL_FILES]...

                user$: ./image_utility.py /dev/sdb archlinux_cityfarm_image_3_12_34_ARCH.img
            
            Or with additional files:

                user$: ./image_utility.py /dev/sdb archlinux_cityfarm_image_3_12_34_ARCH.img whatever_file.txt

    5.  WAIT! This process may take as long as 15 minutes, so be patient. After the utility completes its job
        you may remove the SD card and stick it in the Raspberry Pi and boot it up.
